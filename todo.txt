stuff that effects css:

- add CSS:
    - edit mixtape page
    - user page
    - flash error

- limit description and title (basically all text fields) to reasonable lengths
- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- add admin tools
- move data out of static folder (so i can just .gitignore the whole thing)
- errant TODOs
- escape bad text (e.g. too many newlines)

+ number tracks
+ warn user before adding final track
+ allow editing artwork
+ add limit to number of tracks that can be added
+ automatically convert on track maximum
+ add download links / currently converting to index
+ rename mixtapes to correct name on download, and add art + tracklist to description
+ add tracklist to finished mixtapes
+ make art mandatory
+ allow mixtapes to be streamed
+ add description to tracks

not mvp:
- add user descriptions
- paginate index page
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion
- show all mixtapes contributed/created as user
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- add comments section to mixtapes?
