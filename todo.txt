stuff that effects css:
+ add limit to number of tracks that can be added
+ automatically convert on track maximum

- add download links / currently converting to index
- number tracks
- show all mixtapes contributed/created as user
- paginate index page
- add description to tracks
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- add CSS
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible

- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- add admin tools
- move data out of static folder (so i can just .gitignore the whole thing)
- errant TODOs
- rename mixtapes to correct name on download, and add art + tracklist to description
- add tracklist to finished mixtapes

not mvp:
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion
