stuff that effects css:
+ add limit to number of tracks that can be added
+ automatically convert on track maximum
+ add download links / currently converting to index

+ rename mixtapes to correct name on download, and add art + tracklist to description
+ add tracklist to finished mixtapes
+ make art mandatory

- allow mixtapes to be streamed
- prompt user to create k

- add description to tracks
- limit description and title (basically all text fields) to reasonable lengths
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- number tracks
- paginate index page
- add CSS
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible

- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- add admin tools
- move data out of static folder (so i can just .gitignore the whole thing)
- errant TODOs

not mvp:
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion
- show all mixtapes contributed/created as user
