stuff that effects css:

- read # per tape in index.html from var
- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- move data out of static folder (so i can just .gitignore the whole thing)
- errant TODOs

+ limit USERNAME ! description and title (basically all text fields) to reasonable lengths
+ number tracks
+ warn user before adding final track
+ allow editing artwork
+ add limit to number of tracks that can be added
+ automatically convert on track maximum
+ add download links / currently converting to index
+ rename mixtapes to correct name on download, and add art + tracklist to description
+ add tracklist to finished mixtapes
+ make art mandatory
+ allow mixtapes to be streamed
+ add description to tracks
+ add CSS:
    + edit mixtape page
    + user page
    + flash error

not mvp:
- add user descriptions
- paginate index page
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion (doesn't make sense if you're not the one adding the final track)
- show all mixtapes contributed/created as user
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- add admin tools
- escape bad text (e.g. too many newlines)
- use actual mysql DB
- add avatars to posts
